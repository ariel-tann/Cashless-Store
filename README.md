# Cashless-Store
Cashless store is a C# console application that allows a cashier to process n items from a number of customers, one by one, in turn. 

The application will prompt for the name and price of the items and produce a final invoice when there are no more items to process. A four digit credit card number is taken for payment, and discounts are given depending on the total amount spent.
